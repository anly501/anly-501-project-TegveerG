        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "For ARM analysis, we shall use the cleaned REKT Database that we used for classification analysis. Like clustering analysis, ARM does not require a response variable beacuse it is an unsupervised machine learning method. However, unlike clustering, we do not drop the target variable (Y) of scam_type_grouped for ARM and treat it as a feature. Moreover, we will use the categorical variables month_of_attack and day_of_week_of_attack as two additional features. For simplicity, the day_of_year_of_attack variable shall be dropped because month_of_attack and day_of_week_of_attack convey enough information for datetime features. Additionally, because ARM requires all variables to be categorical, we shall convert the log funds (lost and returned) variables into their original dollar values and discretize them for accurate analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The feature data (X) that we will eventually be left with will contain 6 record features, including two features of discretized funds (lost and returned), two datetime extracted features of month_of_attack and day_of_week_of_attack, and two categorical variables scamNetworks, which denotes the type of project or token associated with the attack, and scam_type_grouped, which denotes the type of attack (Exit Scam or Exploit). By the end of the analysis, we will showcase how these six variables relate with each other in terms of the rules generated by the Apriori Algorithm. We shall also make use of the support, confidence, and lift metrics to analyse the results of the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Theory\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Association Rule Mining (ARM) and the Apriori Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "ARM is an unsupervised rule-based machine learning method that learns associations among item-sets or attributes. An item-set is a collection of attribute values that appears in one or more training examples. The rules take the form of \"if-then\" statements, including a precondition and conclusion. Format:\n",
        "If precondition, Then conclusion (If A -> Then B, where A and B is an item-set). We can also obtain the converse of a rule by swapping the precondition and conclusion. ARM's goal is to find rules (i.e. a model), given a set of transactions (training data), that will predict the occurrence of an item based on the occurrences of other items in the training data. To further understand how these rules are generated we must understand three metrics of a rule:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Support: The popularity of an item set as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an item-set appears. Or, given a rule $A \\Rightarrow B, Support(A, B) = P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{\\text{number of transactions containing A and B}}{\\text{total number of transactions}}$, where A and B are separate item sets that occur in at the same time in a transaction. Therefore, the support denotes how often items with A and items in B occur together relative to all other transactions. Support takes on values between 0 and 1, where 1 signifies that the item-set is highly important and 0 signifies irrelevance. For larger datasets, we prune the number of rules we shall consider by limiting ourselves with a sufficient support threshold. \n",
        "2. Confidence: If the precondition holds true, how likely is it that the conclusion also holds? Therefore, $Confidence(A \\Rightarrow B) = P(B|A) = \\frac{support(A \\cap B)}{support(A)} = \\frac{\\text{number of transactions containing A and B}}{\\text{number of transactions containing A}}$. In words, confidence measures how often items in A and items in B occur together, relative to transactions that contain A. Confidence gauges how statistically “strong” a rule is and, like support, it takes on values between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates that B is bought everytime A is and 0 indicates no instance of the respective rule occuring.\n",
        "3. Lift: How likely item B is present when item A is present, while controlling for how popular item B is. Therefore, $Lift(A \\Rightarrow B) = \\frac{support(A \\cap B)}{support(A) * support(B)}$, given that A and B are independent. A lift value of 1 represents no associations between item-sets, so no rule can be drawn involving those item-sets. A lift value greater than 1 represents a positive relation between the items or, simply put, a dependence on one another. Whereas a lift value lesser than 1 represents negative relation between the items or a substitution effect between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "*It is also important to keep in mind that support does not change when we permute items in the item-set!*\n",
        "\n",
        "The Apriori Algorithm helps learn association rules and can be divided into 2 stages:\n",
        "1. Gradually build up larger and larger item-sets that have sufficient support using a threshold\n",
        "2. Form rules from item-sets by keeping those that have high enough confidence\n",
        "Therefore, if we have n unique items, we obtain $2^n$ total number of item-sets and $3^n - 2^{n+1} + 1$ total possible association rules\n",

        "After performing the Apriori Algorithm, comprising support and confidence thresholds of 5% and lift threshold of 2 (closely dependent associations) on the filtered dataset, the network graph goes deeper into conveying associations with Exploit attacks. This signifies that majority of no funds returned values correspond to Exit Scams! Exploit attacks that resulted in either funds being lost in the high 100K's ($500,000 to $1,000,000) or less than 100K (but greater than $0), also resulted in similiar amounts of funds being returned respectively. We also get a better insight of weekdays and months associated with Exploit attacks. Exploit attacks that occurred in October were closely associated to weekends and attacks that occurred in August were closely associated to weekdays. The insights for Ethereum largely remain the same from the previous graph, but we obtain a better understanding of Exploit attacks on the CEX platform. Attacks on CEX are closely related to the month of January with Mondays and Fridays being the days associated with those attacks in January. \n",

        "# Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "To wrap up, we found that attacks that were Exploits (Access Control, Flash Loan Attacks, and Phishing) were generally linked to the Ethereum chain and lost as well as recovered funds in the low millions (USD). The CEX cryptocurrency platform too was related to exploit attacks and were able to recover funds in the low millions (USD). Exit Scams comprising Honeypot attacks, Rugpull attacks, and Abandoned scams, on the other hand, were attacks that generally resulted in funds lost in the low millions (USD) but not being able to recover any funds. Moreover, exit scam attacks had a lower association with the other item sets in the dataset compared to that of exploit attacks. Exploit attacks were common on weekends rather than weekdays. Our dataset was conducive to running the Apriori Algorithm on it; however, a larger dataset would take more time train on and may result in more insignificant rules to filter from. \n",
