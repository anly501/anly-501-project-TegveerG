      <td>Terra Classic</td>
      <td>Quick SummaryA complex mixture of events and market dynamics cost the implosion of the $40b Terra (Classic) Network. Details of the ExploitThe Terra Luna Network was focused on its two native coins $LUNC and $USTC. $USTC was the algorithmic Stablecoin that was supposed to hold the peg to 1$ and $LUNC functioned as the satellite asset that absorbed $USTC’s volatility. This was achieved through a mint and burn functionality as well as by arbitrage which the former function inherently enabled.$USTC rose to prominence in rapid fashion even surpassing $DAI in market cap. The Luna Foundation Group decided to start a new Curve4pool with $FRAX, $USTC, $USDC and $USDT as assets, excluding $DAI in an attempt to starve the most used StableCoin pool used by institutions the Curve3pool on the Ethereum network.The migration of $USTC from the Curve3pool is the event that started the bankrun. In early May, the Luna Foundation Guard withdrew 250 million $USTC from the Curve3pool in preparation for the Curve4pool. Simultaneously, a handful of whales withdrew sizeable amounts from the anchor protocol, a crypto savings bank. The biggest wallet withdrew 347 million $USTC in total and bridged funds to the Curve3pool in order to swap for other assets. This movement of funds created an imbalance between $USTC and other Stablecoins in the pool, resulting in devaluation of $USTC on exchanges.As a result of the tokenomics of $USTC and $LUNC the firesale of $USTC resulted in uncontrollable minting of the $LUNC token and a rapid fall in valuation. Additionally, the Terra network went down due to overload in transaction as market participants were panicking and trying to answer margin calls within the Anchor protocol. Eventually massive liquidations of collateral in the Anchor protocol would be incurred by investors.Block Data ReferenceWhale Addresses:https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d47f08ebc5554504742f547eb721a43d4947d0ahttps://etherscan.io/address/0x4b5e60cb1cd6c5e67af5e6cf63229d1614bb781chttps://etherscan.io/address/0x1df8ea15bb725e110118f031e8e71b91abaa2a06https://etherscan.io/address/0xeb5425e650b04e49e5e8b62fbf1c3f60df01f232https://etherscan.io/address/0x41339d9825963515e5705df8d3b0ea98105ebb1chttps://etherscan.io/address/0x68963dc7c28a36fcacb0b39ac2d807b0329b9c69https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f705ff1da72ed334f0e80f90aae5644f5cd7784</td>

      <td>Quick SummaryAmeer and Raees Cajee, the exchange's founders, were reported missing in June 2021 after alleging that almost $3.6 billion invested in the protocol was stolen in a "hack".Details of the ExploitAfricrypt claimed to connect banks, payment providers and digital asset providers for seamless global money transfers.In April 2021, the Africrypt case gained traction. At the time, one of the protocol's founders contacted investors to notify them that the protocol had been compromised. The creator asked that investors refrain from contacting attorneys or law authorities since doing so would "slow the recovery process."However, Africrypt staff lost access to the exchange's back-end systems seven days before the claimed attack, making this report suspect. After receiving notice of the "hack" and its odd request not to contact attorneys or law enforcement, several investors hired a law firm Hanekom Attorneys. The investigation discovered that most of the bitcoin invested with the exchange had been withdrawn and moved through tumblers and mixers to make it harder to track. The founders of Africrypt are still at large and have not been found as the time of this writing.</td>

It enticed investors by promising speedy and guaranteed returns. In the two years afterwards, Bo has recruited numerous others and spread the fraud to other Southeast Asian nations such as China, Cambodia, Malaysia, Vanuatu, and Vietnam.PlusToken operators had devised a pyramid scheme that managed to lure over 2.6 million investors, authorities said. The scam was organized into at least 3,200 investor levels, with more referrals and bigger investments bumping an investor up the chain. The operators also lied to investors that they were making money through digital currency investing, according to investors.</td>

BitConnect interest fluctuated greatly with the volatility of Bitcoin, which its value was tied to.The BitConnect Coin was among the world's top 20 most successful cryptocurrency tokens until its price collapsed after traders began losing confidence. BCC rose from a post ICO price of $0.17 to an all-time high of US$463 in December 2017; it declined to US$0.40 as of March 11, 2019. BitConnect released outstanding loans at a rate of US$363.62 to the BitConnect Wallet in form of BCC. However, soon after that news the internal exchange price and liquidity collapsed resulting in a nearly complete loss of value.
