This was achieved through a mint and burn functionality as well as by arbitrage which the former function inherently enabled.</p><p><br></p><p>$USTC rose to prominence in rapid fashion even surpassing $DAI in market cap. The Luna Foundation Group decided to start a new Curve4pool with $FRAX, $USTC, $USDC and $USDT as assets, excluding $DAI in an attempt to starve the most used StableCoin pool used by institutions the Curve3pool on the Ethereum network.</p><p><br></p><p>The migration of $USTC from the Curve3pool is the event that started the bankrun. In early May, the Luna Foundation Guard withdrew 250 million $USTC from the Curve3pool in preparation for the Curve4pool. Simultaneously, a handful of whales withdrew sizeable amounts from the anchor protocol, a crypto savings bank. The biggest wallet withdrew 347 million $USTC in total and bridged funds to the Curve3pool in order to swap for other assets. This movement of funds created an imbalance between $USTC and other Stablecoins in the pool, resulting in devaluation of $USTC on exchanges.</p><p><br></p><p>As a result of the tokenomics of $USTC and $LUNC the firesale of $USTC resulted in uncontrollable minting of the $LUNC token and a rapid fall in valuation. Additionally, the Terra network went down due to overload in transaction as market participants were panicking and trying to answer margin calls within the Anchor protocol. Eventually massive liquidations of collateral in the Anchor protocol would be incurred by investors.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Whale Addresses:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d47f08ebc5554504742f547eb721a43d4947d0a</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x4b5e60cb1cd6c5e67af5e6cf63229d1614bb781c</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x1df8ea15bb725e110118f031e8e71b91abaa2a06</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xeb5425e650b04e49e5e8b62fbf1c3f60df01f232</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x41339d9825963515e5705df8d3b0ea98105ebb1c</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x68963dc7c28a36fcacb0b39ac2d807b0329b9c69</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f705ff1da72ed334f0e80f90aae5644f5cd7784</p>","name_categories":"Stablecoin","token_name":"LUNC, USTC","proof_archive_link":"https://twitter.com/OnChainWizard/status/1524123935570382851, https://rekt.news/ru/luna-rekt/, https://mobile.twitter.com/hasufl/status/1523817151471230976","technical_issue":null,"token_address":"0x7e43d25EaD96B1058f671F6690ea705BA2C7e5B9, 0xa47c8bf37f92abed4a126bda807a7b7498661acd","logo_link":"safe/files/scamDatabase/logo/62b31ccc0d07e.jpeg","date":"2022-5-8","proof_link":"https://www.nansen.ai/research/on-chain-forensics-demystifying-terrausd-de-peg?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=Research_USTdepeg_27May22, https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/luna-crypto-crash-how-ust-broke-and-whats-next-for-terra/, https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/binance-ceo-says-luna-collapse-left-him-poor-again/#:~:text=Key%20points,and%20make%20a%20new%20plan., https://medium.com/coinmonks/whats-happening-with-the-terra-luna-seed-money-exit","website_link":"https://www.terra.money/","webarchive_link":null,"twitter_link":"https://twitter.com/terra_money","telegram_link":"https://t.me/TerraNetworkLobby","our_post_link":null,"funds_lost":"40000000000","funds_returned":null,"active":1,"git_hub":"https://github.com/terra-money/","git_hub_contract_link":null,"discord":"https://twitter.com/terra_money","bug_bounty_program_link":null,"bug_bounty_program_company":null,"audit_code_conf":0,"is_verified_source_code":0,"is_public_team":1,"scam_type":{"type":"Bank Run"},"network":{},"scamNetworks":[{"networks_id":1003,"scam_database_id":3058,"networks":{"id":1003,"name":"Terra Classic","icon_link":"safe/files/network/terra-classic.png"}}],"auditedBy":[{"audit_link":"safe/files/audit/pdf/CertiK_Audit_for_Terra_v18.pdf","date":"2020-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","partner":{"id":8,"name":"Certik","logo_link":"safe/files/partner/logo/609520cbb1bba.png"}}]},{"id":2762,"project_name":"Africrypt","description":"<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>Ameer and Raees Cajee, the exchange's founders, were reported missing in June 2021 after alleging that almost $3.6 billion invested in the protocol was stolen in a \"hack\".</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>Africrypt claimed to connect banks, payment providers and digital asset providers for seamless global money transfers.</p><p><br></p><p>In April 2021, the Africrypt case gained traction.

This hack was made possible by an operational error incurred by the team, which had been found and commented upon in an audit report made by Quantstamp. Essentially, at the initialization of the contract the \"process()\" function checks messages for an acceptable merkle root. The team accidentally marked the zero root (0x00) as acceptable. This error enabled every message to be auto-proven by default. Essentially, the attacker was able to process transactions without any proving by calling the function \"process()\".</p><p>This information spread within the community and all that was needed to participate in the looting of the protocol was finding a transaction that worked and copy-pasting the transaction with the wallet of desire at the receiving end.

The Elrond team paused the work of Maiar DEX, they also froze stablecoins so that the hacker would not be able to withdraw funds through the bridge to another network.

The XINV price is calculated of INV from SushiSwap INV/ETH pair.</p><p>4) With the rise in the price of XINV, the attacker was able to borrow assets using minted XINV tokens.</p><p><br></p><p>Exploiter addresses:&nbsp;</p><p>1) https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b4c1083cd6aef062298e1fa900df9832c8351b3</p><p>2) https://etherscan.io/address/0x117c0391b3483e32aa665b5ecb2cc539669ea7e9</p><p>Exploiter contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0xea0c959bbb7476ddd6cd4204bdee82b790aa1562</p>","name_categories":"Borrowing and Lending","token_name":"INV","proof_archive_link":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220621174603/https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1539303274544873473, https://web.archive.org/web/20220621174706/https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/3HEBdgXIaSemB73rTFNrXT-inverse-finance-02-april-2022","technical_issue":null,"token_address":"0x41D5D79431A913C4aE7d69a668ecdfE5fF9DFB68","logo_link":"safe/files/scamDatabase/logo/62b9803c196c4.png","date":"2022-4-2","proof_link":"https://twitter.com/InverseFinance/status/1510228038352457733","website_link":"https://twitter.com/InverseFinance/status/1510228038352457733","webarchive_link":null,"twitter_link":"https://twitter.com/InverseFinance","telegram_link":"https://t.me/InverseFinance","our_post_link":null,"funds_lost":"14500000","funds_returned":null,"active":1,"git_hub":"https://github.com/InverseFinance","git_hub_contract_link":"https://github.com/InverseFinance/inverse-protocol/tree/main/contracts","discord":"https://discord.com/invite/YpYJC7R5nv","bug_bounty_program_link":null,"bug_bounty_program_company":null,"audit_code_conf":null,"is_verified_source_code":1,"is_public_team":0,"scam_type":{"type":"Price Manipulation"},"network":{},"scamNetworks":[{"networks_id":1,"scam_database_id":3061,"networks":{"id":1,"name":"Ethereum","icon_link":"safe/files/network/ethereum.png"}}],"auditedBy":[]},{"id":2554,"project_name":"FURUCOMBO","description":"<p>The attacker's address:<br>https://etherscan.io/address/0xb624E2b10b84a41687caeC94BDd484E48d76B212<br><br>The transaction behind the attack:<br>https://ethtx.info/mainnet/0x5af11a27e98a167b61b01fea093cf612d5ec76c20fd2032f2d1aa49c8b1ee529/<br><br>The contract with the malicious implementation:<br>https://etherscan.io/address/0x86765dde9304bea32f65330d266155c4fa0c4f04<br><br>The attacker made the Furucombo proxy contract think that Aave V2 had a new implementation.
