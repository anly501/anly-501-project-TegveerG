0,3058,Terra Classic,"<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>A complex mixture of events and market dynamics cost the implosion of the $40b Terra (Classic) Network.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The Terra Luna Network was focused on its two native coins $LUNC and $USTC. $USTC was the algorithmic Stablecoin that was supposed to hold the peg to 1$ and $LUNC functioned as the satellite asset that absorbed $USTC’s volatility. This was achieved through a mint and burn functionality as well as by arbitrage which the former function inherently enabled.</p><p><br></p><p>$USTC rose to prominence in rapid fashion even surpassing $DAI in market cap. The Luna Foundation Group decided to start a new Curve4pool with $FRAX, $USTC, $USDC and $USDT as assets, excluding $DAI in an attempt to starve the most used StableCoin pool used by institutions the Curve3pool on the Ethereum network.</p><p><br></p><p>The migration of $USTC from the Curve3pool is the event that started the bankrun. In early May, the Luna Foundation Guard withdrew 250 million $USTC from the Curve3pool in preparation for the Curve4pool. Simultaneously, a handful of whales withdrew sizeable amounts from the anchor protocol, a crypto savings bank. The biggest wallet withdrew 347 million $USTC in total and bridged funds to the Curve3pool in order to swap for other assets. This movement of funds created an imbalance between $USTC and other Stablecoins in the pool, resulting in devaluation of $USTC on exchanges.</p><p><br></p><p>As a result of the tokenomics of $USTC and $LUNC the firesale of $USTC resulted in uncontrollable minting of the $LUNC token and a rapid fall in valuation. Additionally, the Terra network went down due to overload in transaction as market participants were panicking and trying to answer margin calls within the Anchor protocol. Eventually massive liquidations of collateral in the Anchor protocol would be incurred by investors.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Whale Addresses:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d47f08ebc5554504742f547eb721a43d4947d0a</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x4b5e60cb1cd6c5e67af5e6cf63229d1614bb781c</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x1df8ea15bb725e110118f031e8e71b91abaa2a06</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xeb5425e650b04e49e5e8b62fbf1c3f60df01f232</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x41339d9825963515e5705df8d3b0ea98105ebb1c</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x68963dc7c28a36fcacb0b39ac2d807b0329b9c69</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f705ff1da72ed334f0e80f90aae5644f5cd7784</p>",Stablecoin,"LUNC, USTC","0x7e43d25EaD96B1058f671F6690ea705BA2C7e5B9, 0xa47c8bf37f92abed4a126bda807a7b7498661acd",2022-05-08,"https://www.nansen.ai/research/on-chain-forensics-demystifying-terrausd-de-peg?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=Research_USTdepeg_27May22, https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/luna-crypto-crash-how-ust-broke-and-whats-next-for-terra/, https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/binance-ceo-says-luna-collapse-left-him-poor-again/#:~:text=Key%20points,and%20make%20a%20new%20plan., https://medium.com/coinmonks/whats-happening-with-the-terra-luna-seed-money-exit",,40000000000.0,,1,0.0,1.0,{'type': 'Bank Run'},{},"[{'networks_id': 1003, 'scam_database_id': 3058, 'networks': {'id': 1003, 'name': 'Terra Classic', 'icon_link': 'safe/files/network/terra-classic.png'}}]","[{'audit_link': 'safe/files/audit/pdf/CertiK_Audit_for_Terra_v18.pdf', 'date': '2020-09-03T00:00:00.000Z', 'partner': {'id': 8, 'name': 'Certik', 'logo_link': 'safe/files/partner/logo/609520cbb1bba.png'}}]",5.0,6.0,128.0

This hack was made possible by an operational error incurred by the team, which had been found and commented upon in an audit report made by Quantstamp. Essentially, at the initialization of the contract the ""process()"" function checks messages for an acceptable merkle root. The team accidentally marked the zero root (0x00) as acceptable. This error enabled every message to be auto-proven by default.

The hype surrounding the Netflix show combined with the increased interest in crypto due to the bull market incentivized big news outlets such as BBC and CNBC to write about the rapid surge in price of the new $SQUID token. Retailers around the world pushed the price from $0,01 to $2,861 in little over a week. CoinMarketCap published a warning concerning this project from the start as early investors reported that the sell of the token on pancake swap was not possible. A look at the smart contract revealed that all 3 contracts: SQUID, Marbles, and MasterChef were upgradable. Meaning the contract deployer would change the mechanisms of the project at will.<br>For example a new MasterChef made it possible for the 0x71 EOA to withdraw all tokens from the MasterChef contract at the following transaction:<br>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xf7c9d0e5a81999f9e06fe78df7ce41da112d8bd4f2da7b16cfdbbe46c92cb6af</p><p>The Squid game project boasted two token. The $Marbels token was required in order to be eligible to sell $SQUID on the open market. $Marbles were not tradable on the market and could only be obtained by participating in the game with an entrance fee of $SQUID 456. Meaning at the all time high price of the SQUID token a withdrawal would have costed at least $1,3 million.</p><p>The contract deployer also blacklisted all users that did not hold Marble's token to prevent from selling SQUID in this transaction:<br>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x5b82e96fccaa9ccc3255b509df51d127aa7ad402624f07683855d0e1c4555041</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Involved EOA addresses:<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x71d934aa2119ca3995f702f075d540f7a6b0f728<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x34400280a169f4685193926a513618cf7fe7f0aa<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x1f5eabba9c56bca4a7828969b79bc87051125b31<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x3228eea3d2b7118f09f13a936f26c54e8f9bfb65</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>0x32 invoked the internal protocol's contract which worked as the interface of the PancakeSwap pair contract to sell SQUID tokens at multiple transactions under the ""0x5c2a8729"" method:<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x3228eea3d2b7118f09f13a936f26c54e8f9bfb65<br><br>Example of <span style='color: rgb(65, 65, 65); font-family: ""Open Sans"", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;'>""0x5c2a8729""&nbsp;</span>transaction:<br>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x98a07fde52914566a72b7eeb2ec1b1af3cb9a0a1d817bb1fb8d6d204993ae96a<br><br>The WBNB recipient was EOA, marked as SQUID Token Rug 2, which then deposited stolen funds into Tornado Cash Proxy:<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x34400280a169f4685193926a513618cf7fe7f0aa<br><br>2 unverified smart contracts were used to sell SQUID tokens:<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x95eb532f23a97191324103755332a3dff97d722f<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x5b871670d4f1d81591ecf641588a28f5032c9dcd</p>",Gaming / Metaverse,"SQUID, Marbles","0x87230146E138d3F296a9a77e497A2A83012e9Bc5, 0x9531c509a24ceec710529645fc347341ff9f15ea",2021-11-01,"https://cryptopotato.com/squid-game-pulls-the-rug-squid-price-crashes-99-99/, https://www.cmnnews.live/squid-game-rugpull-from-2856-to-0-0008-in-10-minutes/, https://twitter.com/TrustWallet/status/1455148681351483393, https://twitter.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1455183210149818371",http://web.archive.org/web/20211014075428/https://squidgame.cash/,5723268.0,,1,0.0,0.0,{'type': 'Exit Scam'},{},"[{'networks_id': 56, 'scam_database_id': 2689, 'networks': {'id': 56, 'name': 'Binance', 'icon_link': 'safe/files/network/bsc.png'}}]",[],11.0,0.0,305.0

162,2975,Bitcoin Savings and Trust,"<p>Bitcoin Savings &amp; Trust (abbreviated as BST) was a Ponzi scheme operated by Trendon Shavers (then known as Pirate). It was launched in November 2011 as First Pirate Savings &amp; Trust. Pirate claimed to have been selling bitcoins to some local tight-lipped buyers, and that he started BST to provide more volume to these buyers. By selling invested bitcoins at a high rate and rebuying them at the market price, Pirate was supposedly able to offer a very high-yield interest rate of 7% per week. This rate attracted many investors, and Pirate claimed that over 500,000 bitcoins had been deposited.<br><br>After accumulating an ever-larger amount of bitcoin, transactions were becoming difficult and expensive. Pirate attempted to reduce the strain by lowering the interest rate, but this sparked unrest and mass withdrawals. After a discussion with his clients, Pirate decided to close BST and announced his intentions to return all owned bitcoins. After repaying at least 11 small beneficiaries, BST suddenly announced a default on August 28, 2012. It was later revealed that the missing money went towards ""rent, car-related expenses, utilities, retail purchases, casinos, and meals.""</p>",,,,2012-07-02,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=576337#post_bitcoin_savings_and_trust,,4630000.0,,1,0.0,0.0,{'type': 'Exit Scam'},{},[],[],7.0,0.0,184.0

This is the crucial step in this incident since the Cheese Bank uses the amount of WETH in a liquidity pool to estimate the price of the corresponding LP token. The manipulated UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH pool (with 20k+ WETH) allowed the attacker to drain all the USDC, USDT, and DAI withheld by Cheese Bank by legit <u>borrow</u>() calls<br><br>- refreshed the price feeds of Cheese Bank. The attacker intentionally invoked the <u>CheesePriceOracle::refresh</u>() function to refresh the price of the UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH LP token which is derived from the amount of WETH in the liquidity pool and the ETH price derived from the UNI_V2-USDT-ETH pool. Specifically, the <u>CheesePriceOracle::fetchLPAnhorPrice</u>() function gets the <u>wEthBalance</u> of UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH contract. With the passed in <u>ethPrice</u>, the <u>totalValue</u> is derived by<u>&nbsp;wEthBalance x 2 x ethPrice</u>. Therefore, the unit price of the UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH LP token is computed by <u>totalValue / totalSupply of LP tokens</u>. It means if the attacker could somehow increase the amount of WETH in a pool (e.g., <u>addLiquidity</u>() with flash loan ether), the price of the LP token would be increased<br><br>- drained the USDC, USDT, DAI withheld by Cheese Bank by <u>borrow</u>() calls.

It is noteworthy that the new Terra Network was launched within days after the collapse of the Terra Classic Network. The protocol suffered an exploit in the amount of $2 million caused by outdated oracle price feeds. The price feeds used the price of the new Luna Coin instead of the LunaC. While the new Luna coin was trading at a price around 5$ at the time, the $LUNAC coin was practically worthless at a price point of fractions of a cent. This meant that for $1k in $LUNC an attacker could deposit $1,3 million in deposit and borrow against it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Due to this mechanism, attackers drained several pools on the platform.</p><p><br></p><p style=""margin:0cm;background:white;""><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Example Transaction: https://finder.terra.money/classic/tx/F830681D8FEACC4DA67E84D40C49F0FF805609F2BB5CCC39A0EFE66257F2D791</p>","Borrowing and Lending,Other",MIR,"https://etherscan.io/address/0x09a3EcAFa817268f77BE1283176B946C4ff2E608, https://bscscan.com/address/0x5B6DcF557E2aBE2323c48445E8CC948910d8c2c9, https://finder.terra.money/classic/address/terra15gwkyepfc6xgca5t5zefzwy42uts8l2m4g40k6",2022-05-31,https://www.theblock.co/post/149361/mirror-protocol-suffers-new-exploit-and-could-be-drained-in-hours,,2000000.0,,1,0.0,1.0,{'type': 'Oracle Issue'},{},"[{'networks_id': 1003, 'scam_database_id': 3132, 'networks': {'id': 1003, 'name': 'Terra Classic', 'icon_link': 'safe/files/network/terra-classic.png'}}]",[],5.0,1.0,151.0

These include Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Cool Cats, and Cyberkongz NFTs.<br><br>The exploit:<br>- when you list an item for sale (or bid) you are signing data that validate that you are willing to sell your NFT at this price<br><br>- the signature is saved in OpenSea's DB off-chain and when someone wants to buy your NFT, they will send to their smart contract your previously signed data where the signature and sale information (such as expiration &amp; price) are validated on-chain before making the transfer<br><br>- when you cancel a listing, you are required to perform a transaction. The reason is that someone might save your signed listing (which are public - i.e https://orders.rarible.com or even their API) and use it later, even if the listing got removed from the UI<br><br>- the transaction on-chain will save the fact that you canceled this sale on their smart contract and even if someone will try to use your signed data from before, the on-chain validation will reject the sale<br><br>- the bug stems from the fact that previously you could re-list an NFT without canceling it and all the previous listings are not canceled on-chain, this is why re-listing will not work<br><br>For example, at around 7 am on January 24, a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT #9991 was purchased for 0.77 ETH ($1,800).

After the swap, the attacker acquired 92,419+63,584=156,003 sUSD tokens at his disposal<br><br>- turned to Synthetic Depot contract to acquire substantially more sUSD at market price. Note Synthetic Depot contract allows for depositing Ether for sUSD at a fair rate. The attacker sent 6,000 ETH and bought 943,837 sUSD back (with 2,482 ETH refunded back as there’s no enough sUSD to buy). Note this step is typically launched before the previous step. For whatever reason, this is not the case in this particular hack (and the ordering does not affect the final result as the pricing in Synthetic Depot is not affected by KyberSwap)<br><br>- the sUSD/ETH price was driven up and the attacker has &gt;1M sUSD at his disposal. Note that the attacker takes the approach by capitalizing on the spiked price in a profitable Compound position in the first hack. Considering the possibly low liquidity of sUSD, the attacker this time takes the approach of first collateralizing the collected &gt;1M sUSD back into bZx and then borrowing from it 6,796 ETH. As bZx relies on Kyber for the price feed, with the spiked sUSD/ETH price, the collection of &gt;1M sUSD allows for the borrow of 6796 ETH. With the normal conversion rate of 1ETH=111 sUSD, the same amount of sUSD tokens can only buy 4,000 ETH, which indicates that this loan is now underwater with insufficient collateralization<br><br>- the attacker repaid the 7,500 ETH flash loan back to bZx with a profit of 2,378 ETH</p>",,BZRX,0x56d811088235F11C8920698a204A5010a788f4b3,2020-02-18,"https://peckshield.medium.com/bzx-hack-ii-full-disclosure-with-detailed-profit-analysis-8126eecc1360, https://www.coindesk.com/defi-project-bzx-exploited-for-second-time-in-a-week-loses-630k-in-ether",,665840.0,,1,0.0,0.0,{'type': 'Flash Loan Attack'},{},"[{'networks_id': 1, 'scam_database_id': 2361, 'networks': {'id': 1, 'name': 'Ethereum', 'icon_link': 'safe/files/network/ethereum.png'}}]","[{'audit_link': 'safe/files/audit/pdf/REP_Bzx_04_09_2020.pdf', 'date': '2020-09-04T00:00:00.000Z', 'partner': {'id': 8, 'name': 'Certik', 'logo_link': 'safe/files/partner/logo/609520cbb1bba.png'}}, {'audit_link': 'safe/files/audit/pdf/peckshield_audit_report_bZxV2_v1_0rc1.pdf', 'date': '2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z', 'partner': {'id': 12, 'name': 'PeckShield Inc.', 'logo_link': 'safe/files/partner/logo/6095235554623.jpeg'}}, {'audit_link': 'safe/files/audit/pdf/bZx_V2_PQ_Review_PQ_Reviews.pdf', 'date': '2020-10-06T00:00:00.000Z', 'partner': {'id': 23, 'name': 'DeFi Safety', 'logo_link': 'safe/files/partner/logo/6154df0c5cbef.png'}}, {'audit_link': 'safe/files/audit/pdf/bzx_audit_2.pdf', 'date': '2018-09-01T00:00:00.000Z', 'partner': {'id': 34, 'name': 'ZK Labs', 'logo_link': 'safe/files/partner/logo/60dcb0383c77c.jpeg'}}]",2.0,1.0,49.0

The attacker took 370,000 $USD after interacting with several assets.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The attacker interacted with Cauldron, Aave, JoeSwap, and Curve for various purposes. The attacker used a malicious smart contract with an unverified source code to withdraw 998,000 $nxUSD using LP tokens worth 500,000 $USDC. The full attack flow of the exploit transaction succeeded as follows:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. The attackers malicious contract flashloaned 51,000,000 $USDC from Aave</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. 280,000 $USDC were swapped to $WAVAX with JoeSwap</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. liquidity was added using claimed $WAVAX and 260,000 $USDC so 0.0045 JoeLPToken was received</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;4. The remaining 50,460,000 $USDC were swapped for $WAVAX on JoeSwap and it changed the reserve of the pool</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;5. The attackers contract called the updateExchangeRate function on the CauldronV2 smart contract, which changed the ExchangeRate variable according to the previous JoeSwap pool's reserve amount</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;6. The attackers contract deposited 0.0045 JoeLPToken to the CauldronV2 and 998,000 $nxUSD were withdrawn from DegenBox. Because of the manipulated ExchangeRate variable, the attacker was able to take that amount for 500,000 $USD worth JoeLPTokens</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;7. The remaining $WAVAX were swapped back for 50,426,896 $USDC on the previous JoeSwap pool</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;8. Consequently, Curve.fi and other pools were used to swap 998,000 $nxUSD for 970,010 $USDC</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;9. The 51,025,500 $USDC for the flash loan were paid back to Aave</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;10.

829,2592,Iron Finance (2),"<p>On the 16th of April, TITAN reached an all-time high of $64 and some investors cashed out. As a result, the price dropped to $60, where it remained for a time.<br><br>However, when TITAN fell below $60, it prompted a fresh wave of selling by big investors, commonly known as whales, driving the price down below $30. Because of the decline in the TITAN price, the IRON stablecoin lost its peg and fell to $0.90. This is where the real issues started.<br><br>The price oracle, which is a smart contract that generates token prices from liquidity pools, could not keep up with the volatility since it utilizes a 10 minute Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) to determine the CR. Users could purchase IRON tokens for $0.90 and instantly redeem them for $0.75 USDC and $0.25 TITAN, which they could then sell for a risk-free profit.<br><br>Investors were ready to purchase dips in IRON and TITAN, helping IRON to briefly reclaim its peg and driving the TITAN price back up to $50.<br><br>This triggered another wave of selling as additional major traders began to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity, flooding the market with newly minted TITAN and finally dumping it as the price approached zero. As a result, IRON fell further, reaching a low of $0.58 before rebounding to $0.74 at the time of writing.<br><br>The TITAN supply that was supposed to be capped at 1 billion tokens expanded without limit.</p>",,TITAN,0xaaa5b9e6c589642f98a1cda99b9d024b8407285a,2021-06-16,"https://ironfinance.medium.com/iron-finance-post-mortem-17-june-2021-6a4e9ccf23f5, https://cointelegraph.com/news/mark-cuban-calls-for-stablecoin-regulation-in-wake-of-iron-finance-bank-run, https://thedefiant.io/iron-finance-implodes-after-bank-run/",,,,1,,,{'type': 'Bank Run'},{},"[{'networks_id': 137, 'scam_database_id': 2592, 'networks': {'id': 137, 'name': 'Polygon', 'icon_link': 'safe/files/network/polygon.png'}}]",[],6.0,2.0,167.0

2034,1308,Test,"<p>A complex mixture of events and market dynamics cost the implosion of the $40b Terra (Classic) Network.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Terra Luna Network was focused on its two native coins $LUNC and $USTC. $USTC was the algorithmic Stablecoin that was supposed to hold the peg to 1$ and $LUNC functioned as the satellite asset that absorbed $USTC’s volatility. This was achieved through a mint and burn functionality as well as by arbitrage which the former function inherently enabled.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>$USTC rose to prominence in rapid fashion even surpassing $DAI in market cap. The Luna Foundation Group decided to start a new Curve4pool with $FRAX, $USTC, $USDC and $USDT as assets, excluding $DAI in an attempt to starve the most used StableCoin pool used by institutions the Curve3pool on the Ethereum network.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The migration of $USTC from the Curve3pool is the event that started the bankrun. In early May, the Luna Foundation Guard withdrew 250 million $USTC from the Curve3pool in preparation for the Curve4pool. Simultaneously, a handful of whales withdrew sizeable amounts from the anchor protocol, a crypto savings bank. The biggest wallet withdrew 347 million $USTC in total and bridged funds to the Curve3pool in order to swap for other assets. This movement of funds created an imbalance between $USTC and other Stablecoins in the pool, resulting in devaluation of $USTC on exchanges.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As a result of the tokenomics of $USTC and $LUNC the firesale of $USTC resulted in uncontrollable minting of the $LUNC token and a rapid fall in valuation. Additionally, the Terra network went down due to overload in transaction as market participants were panicking and trying to answer margin calls within the Anchor protocol. Eventually massive liquidations of collateral in the Anchor protocol would be incurred by investors.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Blockdata Reference</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Whale Addresses:</p><p><br></p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d47f08ebc5554504742f547eb721a43d4947d0a</p><p><br></p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x4b5e60cb1cd6c5e67af5e6cf63229d1614bb781c</p><p><br></p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x1df8ea15bb725e110118f031e8e71b91abaa2a06</p><p><br></p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xeb5425e650b04e49e5e8b62fbf1c3f60df01f232</p><p><br></p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x41339d9825963515e5705df8d3b0ea98105ebb1c</p><p><br></p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x68963dc7c28a36fcacb0b39ac2d807b0329b9c69</p><p><br></p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f705ff1da72ed334f0e80f90aae5644f5cd7784</p>",CeFi,Test,0xf30e4da2af4ebc4172e412ecd1e7a5d8fb600e30,2021-10-24,"https://twitter.com/Token_Sniffer/status/1381346761566916614, 	https://cryptot3ddybear.gitlab.io/blog/posts/scam-explained-bsc-stealthy-lp-block/",,,,1,0.0,0.0,{'type': 'Honeypot'},{},"[{'networks_id': 1666600003, 'scam_database_id': 1308, 'networks': {'id': 1666600003, 'name': 'CEX', 'icon_link': 'safe/files/network/cex.png'}}]",[],10.0,6.0,297.0
