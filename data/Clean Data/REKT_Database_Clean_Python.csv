0,Terra Classic,"A complex mixture of events and market dynamics cost the implosion of the $40b Terra (Classic) Network. Details of the ExploitThe Terra Luna Network was focused on its two native coins $LUNC and $USTC. $USTC was the algorithmic Stablecoin that was supposed to hold the peg to 1$ and $LUNC functioned as the satellite asset that absorbed $USTC’s volatility. This was achieved through a mint and burn functionality as well as by arbitrage which the former function inherently enabled.$USTC rose to prominence in rapid fashion even surpassing $DAI in market cap. The Luna Foundation Group decided to start a new Curve4pool with $FRAX, $USTC, $USDC and $USDT as assets, excluding $DAI in an attempt to starve the most used StableCoin pool used by institutions the Curve3pool on the Ethereum network.The migration of $USTC from the Curve3pool is the event that started the bankrun. In early May, the Luna Foundation Guard withdrew 250 million $USTC from the Curve3pool in preparation for the Curve4pool. Simultaneously, a handful of whales withdrew sizeable amounts from the anchor protocol, a crypto savings bank. The biggest wallet withdrew 347 million $USTC in total and bridged funds to the Curve3pool in order to swap for other assets. This movement of funds created an imbalance between $USTC and other Stablecoins in the pool, resulting in devaluation of $USTC on exchanges.As a result of the tokenomics of $USTC and $LUNC the firesale of $USTC resulted in uncontrollable minting of the $LUNC token and a rapid fall in valuation. Additionally, the Terra network went down due to overload in transaction as market participants were panicking and trying to answer margin calls within the Anchor protocol. Eventually massive liquidations of collateral in the Anchor protocol would be incurred by investors.Block Data ReferenceWhale Addresses:https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d47f08ebc5554504742f547eb721a43d4947d0ahttps://etherscan.io/address/0x4b5e60cb1cd6c5e67af5e6cf63229d1614bb781chttps://etherscan.io/address/0x1df8ea15bb725e110118f031e8e71b91abaa2a06https://etherscan.io/address/0xeb5425e650b04e49e5e8b62fbf1c3f60df01f232https://etherscan.io/address/0x41339d9825963515e5705df8d3b0ea98105ebb1chttps://etherscan.io/address/0x68963dc7c28a36fcacb0b39ac2d807b0329b9c69https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f705ff1da72ed334f0e80f90aae5644f5cd7784",Stablecoin,"LUNC, USTC","0x7e43d25EaD96B1058f671F6690ea705BA2C7e5B9, 0xa47c8bf37f92abed4a126bda807a7b7498661acd",[],2022-05-08,"https://www.nansen.ai/research/on-chain-forensics-demystifying-terrausd-de-peg?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=Research_USTdepeg_27May22, https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/luna-crypto-crash-how-ust-broke-and-whats-next-for-terra/, https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/binance-ceo-says-luna-collapse-left-him-poor-again/#:~:text=Key%20points,and%20make%20a%20new%20plan., https://medium.com/coinmonks/whats-happening-with-the-terra-luna-seed-money-exit",,40000000000.0,0.0,1,0.0,1.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",{},['Terra Classic'],"[{'audit_link': 'safe/files/audit/pdf/CertiK_Audit_for_Terra_v18.pdf', 'date': '2020-09-03T00:00:00.000Z', 'partner': {'id': 8, 'name': 'Certik', 'logo_link': 'safe/files/partner/logo/609520cbb1bba.png'}}]",5.0,6.0,128.0

14,Nomad,"The Nomad bridge was exploited for aprox. $190 million by what has to be declared as Web3`s first ""crowd-looting"" event.Details of the ExploitThe Nomad bridge is an interoperability protocol that connects five different blockchains, namely Avalanche, Ethereum, Evmos, Milkomeda C1 and Moonbeam. The initial attack appears to have taken place with this transaction, where 100 (WBTC) were extracted from the protocol; https://etherscan.io/tx/0x61497a1a8a8659a06358e130ea590e1eed8956edbd99dbb2048cfb46850a8f17. This hack was made possible by an operational error incurred by the team, which had been found and commented upon in an audit report made by Quantstamp. Essentially, at the initialization of the contract the ""process()"" function checks messages for an acceptable merkle root. The team accidentally marked the zero root (0x00) as acceptable. This error enabled every message to be auto-proven by default. Essentially, the attacker was able to process transactions without any proving by calling the function ""process()"".This information spread within the community and all that was needed to participate in the looting of the protocol was finding a transaction that worked and copy-pasting the transaction with the wallet of desire at the receiving end. This is the reason why tokens were predominantly extracted in the exact same denomination.The initial attack was followed by hundreds of EOA`s extracting assets such as $WBTC, $FXS, $C3, $DAI, $USDC from the bridge. Amongst the looters were reputable hackers from other exploits such as the Rari Capital Exploiter as well as White hat hackers who intend to return the funds.As the time of this writing approx. $32 million have been returned to the Nomad Recovery Funds Address https://etherscan.io/address/0x94A84433101A10aEda762968f6995c574D1bF154 by white hat hackers and cooperating culprits.Block Data ReferenceAttacker address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x56d8b635a7c88fd1104d23d632af40c1c3aac4e3Attacker contract address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xf57113d8f6ff35747737f026fe0b37d4d7f42777Attack transactions: 1) https://etherscan.io/tx/0x61497a1a8a8659a06358e130ea590e1eed8956edbd99dbb2048cfb46850a8f172) https://etherscan.io/tx/0x29b67e0701ddd910ff6a069aa039015eb78b1ee6d99ad8da5d0ef63916f3fd573) https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdf6bef0d8dee8b44863ac61092a711b877dcfe3d61da93d7289e0c6285af1b454) https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3dbed4a1ebb2289273370ce0ef10302882927abe946299cf2ca3073f1a3dcdd9Nomad ERC20 Bridge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x88a69b4e698a4b090df6cf5bd7b2d47325ad30a3Nomad Recovery Funds Address:https://etherscan.io/address/0x94A84433101A10aEda762968f6995c574D1bF154",Bridge,Nomad: ERC20 Bridge,0x88A69B4E698A4B090DF6CF5Bd7B2D47325Ad30A3,[],2022-08-01,"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nomad-token-bridge-drained-of-190m-in-funds-in-security-exploit, https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/02/nomad-bridge-drained-of-nearly-200-million-in-exploit/, https://www.livemint.com/news/world/cryptocurrency-how-nomad-token-bridge-hack-took-place-that-drained-nearly-200-million-funds-in-exploit-11659418968336.html",,190000000.0,36342325.0,1,1.0,0.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",{},['Ethereum'],"[{'audit_link': 'safe/files/audit/pdf/Nomad_Audit.pdf', 'date': '2022-06-06T00:00:00.000Z', 'partner': {'id': 13, 'name': 'Quantstamp', 'logo_link': 'safe/files/partner/logo/609523dccfbce.jpeg'}}]",8.0,0.0,213.0

The company claims to be solvent despite $160m in assets taken and further states that 90 different assets were affected. Most of the assets taken were worth under $2,5m and therefore the markets should not be shaken by major sell-offs.It appears that Wintermute had suffered a brute force private key compromise. The company used Profanity's services for generating vanity addresses. The private keys were generated in such a way that through using enough computing power every possible combination could be tried through until the code was hacked.Several EOA addresses and two smart contracts have been used to attack the platform. The attacker gained power over Wintermute's wallet and repeatedly used a privileged function to transfer funds from the Wintermute wallet to his malicious smart contracts which then transferred the funds to the attackers EOA address, where the assets are sitting at the moment.Block Data ReferenceAttacker EOA address:https://etherscan.io/address/0xe74b28c2eAe8679e3cCc3a94d5d0dE83CCB84705Attacker smart contracts:https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000ae347930bd1e7b0f35588b92280f9e75https://etherscan.io/address/0x0248f752802b2cfb4373cc0c3bc3964429385c26Transfer transactions:https://etherscan.io/tx/0xedd31e2a949b7957a786d44b071dbe1bc5abd5c57e269edb9ec2bf1af30e9ec4https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc253450fc3e0e124224aef2936c13b371a86056e82e778113fc3ce8800bbe876","CeFi,Yield aggregator",,,[],2022-09-20,"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/20/crypto-market-maker-wintermute-hacked-for-160m-says-ceo/, https://twitter.com/EvgenyGaevoy/status/1572134271011225601, https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/uGiY0j3hwOzQOMcDPGoz9-wintermute-hack",,160000000.0,0.0,1,0.0,1.0,"{'id': 9, 'type': 'Access control'}",{},['Ethereum'],[],9.0,1.0,263.0

Due to this vulnerability, when a $WEGLD contract called a Maiar contract, it allowed Maiar to perform a token transfer in the context of the $WEGLD contract, the calling party. Maiar DEX was successfully recovered by the Elrond team, and user funds were not affectedDetails of the ExploitThe Maiar DEX protocol was attacked by hackers who took advantage of a vulnerability in the WEGLD contract to steal funds from the protocol on the Elrond network. The attacker's accounts were created almost simultaneously and tokens in the amount of 1.959 $EGLD were sent to each of them from Binance Hot Wallet:Block Data Reference1) https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/ba7bcea55911973556c0c855a912c868e76a658792b62a6688c16a14c98a01022) https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/27935d8bceaee5b179bddb1dcd9683a3c227055c8ac70b4bd5f3a40a2b5f6dd13) https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/73f39d3edf0cf5f0893fa3a8175f614329960572e2843f6a21f60b5e1bf778f5After the accounts were created and smart contracts as well, they called the withdraw() function and received a total of 1,650,000 $EGLD. The most important here is the wrat_egls_callback() function. This function enables the wrapping and unwrapping of the $EGLD token.In the transaction below, it can be noticed that as the new smart contract sends a small amount of $EGLD to the wrapEgId() method and this method sends $WEDLD to the wrap_edId_callback() method of the new contract:https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/848b5a96bd95d3537f2bb8cfc5c1ebc5ec580e72214dd75c85be718ae0bbf3fb#4159433916247dbdbfbbf31d8a4cc8ce14a3a86e5a5f7beb1cddcf5abc59b83eDeploying the wrap_egId_callback() method, was found a call of the managedExecuteOnDestContextByCaller() method, which allows attacker to ""ask"" the victim's contract to send funds to any other address that the attacker indicates, which happened during the attack on Maiar DEX. The Elrond team paused the work of Maiar DEX, they also froze stablecoins so that the hacker would not be able to withdraw funds through the bridge to another network. Having connections with other major exchanges, they handed over a blacklist with addresses so that the fraudster would not be able to withdraw funds. The executeOnDestContextByCaller() function was removed to avoid a repeat attack. Then the team began to restore the liquidity pool by returning all funds and restoring the price of the token, based on the price indicated by Binance.Block Data ReferenceAttacker addresses:1) https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd1cura2qq8skel5fsxrpxyysjkaw6durengtkencrezkw78y6y2zhscf854j2) https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd1yrf9qeuqkcjeh5c4xn628mags7cse4r9ra2p2ggmlgfqq3l3v6pqxfu9503) https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd16syfkds2faezhqa7pn5n8fyjkst70l5qefpmc0r960467snlgycq4ww0rtContract addresses:1) https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgq85hhnppjcdamledp3usgkm3lm832jekw2zhsajjztn2) https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgqqucnpav4dguh4zf6nvd48l68k2nxhyu0v6pqqntgfs3) https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgqll7yerx6v67p0s8va0h09dgv7x30nlergycqt2qzmpContract deployment transaction by the attacker address (erd1...854j): https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/9404479926078441d8fd8844ec4787c4c35c554628abdc7605c8084f49299352 Contract deployment transaction by the attacker address (erd1...u950): https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/39c7aebfe5ebbe4bcc285ef5cc99869486705afa4ce94071c5aafc6124864fb7Contract deployment transaction by the attacker address (erd1...ww0rt): https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgqll7yerx6v67p0s8va0h09dgv7x30nlergycqt2qzmpTransactions of theft of funds from the Maiar DEX:400k EGLD: https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/8b8c332577e5b8bdd4e13450ea92b7c6b0ca15399f1f0bb38fc215cfc3ddb490450k EGLD: https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/39998ab5c929fa67e95d0c64081697fc4207235dbfeaaff10fb2704a6c7716b6800k EGLD: https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/41effd8536376f3a2edba7074c02776edae94bb5b464485ac414847202eebbe2Recovered funds were send to one of Elrond addresses: https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd1pml9k2tsqsnvtmmalglt2su0sn3cguvr8e8jq0gy69zw2ldcej2qapml9a",Exchange (DEX),MEX,https://elrondscan.com/token/MEX-455c57,[],2022-06-05,"https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/news/maiar-dex-loses-113-million-worth-of-egld-after-going-offline, https://elrond.com/blog/incident-and-recovery-report/, https://cryptotodayinfo.com/%F0%9F%9A%ABelrond-hacked-%E2%A4%B5%EF%B8%8Fegld-to-5-in-seconds-%E2%8F%AF%EF%B8%8Fexchange-paused-%F0%9F%94%9Cwhere-will-it-all-end/",,113000000.0,113000000.0,1,1.0,1.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",{},['Elrond'],[],6.0,6.0,156.0
28,Horizon by Harmony,"Harmony's Horizon Bridge was exploited by an attacker resulting in losses of roughly $100M. The bridge was secured by multisig wallet which needed 2 out of 5 wallets to confirm transaction. The hacker gained control over 2 wallets which enabled the attacker to drain the funds of the bridge and transfer said funds to his wallet.Details of the Exploit For yet unspecified reasons the attacker gained access over 2 of the 5 multisig wallets.The attacker was able to enter and confirm transactions by himself. The exploit resulted in the loss of: ETH, USDC, WBTC, USDT, DAI, BUSD, AAG, FXS, SUSHI, AAVE, WETH, and FRAX. The ONE token was not affected by this attack.For more context, bridges in DeFi are used to enable interoperability between blockchains. Through bridges a user of DeFi may pursue opportunities in an ecosystem that is not native to the coins or tokens a user is holding. For example through Harmony's Horizon Bridge a user holding $ETH on the Ethereum network could bridge $ETH over to the Harmony blockchain receiving newly minted wrapped $1ETH on a 1:1 ratio. Since the funds on the bridge were seized by the attacker, the receipt was no longer backed by the collateral on a 1:1 ratio. The depreciation of the wrapped assets were felt by users in the form of massive slippages on dexes and other bridges as users tried to flee the Harmony Ecosystem.Below a breakdown of the specific function used by the attacker.1) The multisig owner called the submitTransaction(), then to confirm owner calls confirmTransaction() from the MultiSigWallet with the input transactionId 21106.2) The executeTransaction() function has made an external call with input that will call the unlockEth() function in the Ethmanager contract. The input specifies the amount, recipient, and receiptId to be passed to the unlockEth() function.3) The following steps were repeated with different ids.Block Data ReferenceAttacker transactions:640K BUSD: https://bscscan.com/tx/0x4ed7941394725e49e7423e56553901c4ce841792c70e87adeee282cd78500668Link to attacker draining bridge for ERC20 tokens: https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d043128146654c7683fbf30ac98d7b2285ded00#tokentxnsMultisig wallet addresses that were compromised:1) https://etherscan.io/address/0xf845a7ee8477ad1fb4446651e548901a2635a9152) https://etherscan.io/address/0x812d8622c6f3c45959439e7ede3c580da06f8f25These addresses confirmed the transaction with id 21108.

The attack went unnoticed for 7 months before a Terra community member called FatManTerra identified the exploit.Details of the ExploitThe Mirror Protocol was a synthetic assets protocol that allowed users to deposit USTC or LUNAC with a lockup period in order to mint synthetic stocks and commodities. The protocol allowed user to utilize both short and long strategies. The shorting functionality could only be accessed by locking funds for 14 days. The lock contract would then generate a position ID which was used in order to release the users funds if desired.The attacker initially deposited 100,000 UST to the lock contract in this transaction:https://finder.terra.money/classic/tx/29C9CFBBC9562100A5DB19D705E440CE24768D3BDE399507FA1C2EC2424413C4 in order to prepare the attack.The attacker noticed that the lock contract had a vulnerability which allowed the attacker to unlock funds by using the same position ID over and over again as can be seen in this transaction: https://finder.terra.money/classic/tx/08DD2B70F6C2335D966342C20C1E495FD7A8872310B80BAF3450B942F79EBC1F, exploiting the protocol for approx. $90 million USTC in the process.Block Data ReferenceAttacker address: https://finder.terra.money/mainnet/address/terra1200zm8crgjaj949ta8r7p6pay0qq638js4sdmh","Other,Borrowing and Lending",MIR,https://etherscan.io/token/0x09a3EcAFa817268f77BE1283176B946C4ff2E608,[],2021-10-08,https://www.theblock.co/post/149342/a-90-million-defi-exploit-on-terra-went-unnot,,90000000.0,0.0,1,1.0,1.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",{},[],"[{'audit_link': 'safe/files/audit/pdf/Mirror_v2_Audit_Report.pdf', 'date': '2021-06-22T00:00:00.000Z', 'partner': {'id': 75, 'name': 'Cryptonics', 'logo_link': 'safe/files/partner/logo/6112e9e50dcf2.png'}}]",10.0,4.0,281.0

The protocol confirmed a hack on Twitter, 206,809 $BNB was stolen which was worth 80,000,000 $USD up to that time. The attack flow is below:The attacker:- funded his wallet with 0.8887725 ETH from Tornado Cash- sent 16 deposit transactions to QBridge of Ethereum- sent 16 voteProposal transactions to QBridge contract of BSC by Qubit Relayer - a number of $xETH tokens were minted by 16 voteProposal transactions, and liquidity in Qubit was withdrawn using this as collateral.The attacker called the QBridge deposit function on the Ethereum network, which calls the deposit function QBridgeHandler. QBridgeHandler should receive the $WETH token, which is the original tokenAddress, and if the person who performed the tx does not have a $WETH token, the transfer should not occur.tokenAddress.safeTransferFrom(depositer, address(this), amount);In the deposit function above, tokenAddress is 0, so safeTransferFrom didn’t fail and the deposit function ended normally regardless of the amount value. Additionally, tokenAddress was the $WETH address before depositETH was added, but as depositETH is added, it is replaced with the zero address that is the tokenAddress of ETH.In summary, the deposit function was a function that should not be used after depositETH was newly developed, but it remained in the contract, which allows the attacker to use this to steal the funds.Block Data ReferenceAttacker address:https://etherscan.io/address/0xD01Ae1A708614948B2B5e0B7AB5be6AFA01325c7",Borrowing and Lending,,,[],2022-01-27,https://archive.is/0Ubc7,,80000000.0,0.0,1,0.0,0.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",{},['Binance'],[],1.0,3.0,27.0

59,Cream Finance,"Cream Finance got exploited through a vulnerability hidden in the borrow() function, which was repeatedly utilized for reentrancy attacks. The attacker made away with approx. $36 million.Details of the ExploitCream (Crypto Rules Everything Around Me) Finance is a decentralized lending protocol designed for institutions, protocols and people in order to access financial services.The risk for reentrancy arose because of the way $AMP was integrated into the protocol. The $AMP token contract is based on the ERC777 standard, which utilizes the _callPostTransferHooks hook. The attack transactions started with supplying $ETH as a collateral for borrowing $AMP from the crAMP market. When transferring AMP to the attacking contract, the _callPostTransferHooks was called, which in turn triggered the execution of a fallback function in the attack contract allowing the latter to re-enter the crETH market to borrow $ETH against the very same collateral initially supposed to be used for borrowing $AMP.The flow of an example exploit transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa9a1b8ea288eb9ad315088f17f7c7386b9989c95b4d13c81b69d5ddad7ffe61e- The hacker creates contract A to flash loan 500 $WETH and use the funds as collateral on cream, minting 24.17k crETH;- borrows 19.48M $AMP for the received crETH;- exploits the reentrancy possibility by repeatedly calling borrow() during the token transfer, taking a further 355 $ETH before the state of the initial borrow() has been updated;- uses contract B, which receives a half (9.74M) of A's borrowed $AMP;- contract B liquidates part of A's loan, redeeming 187 $WETH and transferring it back to contract A;- contract A uses $ETH borrowed via reentrancy to repay the remainder of the flash loan.The profits of the above explained transaction amounted to 41 $ETH and 9.74M $AMP.In total, 17 attack transactions were conducted netting the attackers a total of $AMP 462,079,976 and $ETH 2,804.96.Block Data ReferenceAttack contract A:https://etherscan.io/address/0x38c40427efbaae566407e4cde2a91947df0bd22bAttack contract B:https://etherscan.io/address/0x0ec306D7634314D35139d1dF4A630d829475A125Exploiter address 1:https://etherscan.io/address/0xce1f4b4f17224ec6df16eeb1e3e5321c54ff6edeExploiter address 2:https://etherscan.io/address/0x8036EbD0Fc9C120BA0469ffCB27b204AA06aaF1F",Borrowing and Lending,CREAM,https://etherscan.io/token/0x2ba592F78dB6436527729929AAf6c908497cB200,[],2021-08-31,"https://medium.com/cream-finance/c-r-e-a-m-finance-post-mortem-amp-exploit-6ceb20a630c5, https://rekt.news/cream-rekt/",,36154954.0,0.0,1,0.0,0.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",{},['Ethereum'],[],8.0,1.0,243.0

Essentially, Meerkat Finance was a lending and yield aggregation protocol offering its users yield through lending assets or pledging assets to the platforms vaults. The vaults would pursuit automated investment strategies.This rekt case gained traction when the contract deployer invoked the upgradeTo() function, setting new implementation to the BUSD Vault at:https://bscscan.com/tx/0xf19fa4bcff4adaebeddd28c851458ba0f01ffedd52b62df56ace94e7c8842553The contract deployer also invoked the upgradeTo() function, setting new implementation to WBNB Vault at:https://bscscan.com/tx/0x063970f8625f250101a7da8abf914748cf8eaaaa9458041f1928501accfe5This altered the vault logic, introducing two new functions that were not included in the earlier implementations. This is where the real danger of proxy upgradable smart contracts lies. Code is king in DeFi and rather than trusting mediators users of DeFi can trust the code. However, when the code becomes changeable and upgradable by a centralized entity without governance by the token holder, the story changes.An external address, marked as Fake_Phishing 17, invoked init() function to the Vaults through the proxy contract at:https://bscscan.com/tx/0xfcf48681e382e9f9cc1d6a64ff30487306f6b869924c6594075fcc86b3b21f5dhttps://bscscan.com/tx/0x5050d0f2f2d4d8ea76b04f25b1ee04b04d2b7beb6dafc6921672eaa448345027According to decompiled bytecode, this function sets the address on storage slot 0 to the address provided to the function.

As a consequence, 290 imBTC were deducted from the attacker's balance under the integrated withdraw(). When the execution returned to supply(), however, the balance was reset to 290 imBTC. This is how the attacker modifies the internal record of the imBTC collateral amount in Lendf.Me. With a big enough collateral value, the attack can thus borrow all available assets from multiple liquidity pools.The withdrawal of the funds by the attacker:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9a5899d2151d84a9a8dccd1b1a03abbdf91ea83b1f78f3c631b858c20658c12d",Borrowing and Lending,USDx,0xeb269732ab75a6fd61ea60b06fe994cd32a83549,[],2020-04-19,"https://medium.com/dforcenet/a-summary-of-the-attack-on-lendf-me-on-april-19-2020-e2f1c5d96640, https://peckshield.medium.com/uniswap-lendf-me-hacks-root-cause-and-loss-analysis-50f3263dcc09",,25236849.0,25236849.0,1,0.0,0.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",{},['Ethereum'],[],4.0,6.0,110.0

Doing so would burn the deposited EMN. Inversely, if you deposit these tokens into their respective bonding curve contracts, it is burned and you receive newly minted EMN.To exploit these contracts, the attacker took out a flash loan for 15 million DAI from Uniswap and used this to buy EMN. He then traded and burned half this EMN for eAAVE, driving up EMN’s price. From here, he traded the rest of his EMN for DAI, traded his eAAVE to mint more EMN and then finally traded this EMN for DAI.This process was repeated three times to net the hacker 15,015,533 DAI.8M DAI were returned back to the Yearn deployer at:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7bc97357364222207f1f011b22ad98ba78fcd3c25d3398346caa3928cdf4a4dd",Gaming / Metaverse,EMN,0x5ade7ae8660293f2ebfcefaba91d141d72d221e8,[],2020-09-29,"https://defirate.com/eminence-emn-rug-pull/, https://www.coindesk.com/eminence-exploit-defi-compensated",,15113001.0,8000000.0,1,0.0,0.0,"{'id': 15, 'type': 'Flash Loan Attack'}",{},['Ethereum'],[],9.0,1.0,273.0

The attacker purchased INV tokens, and with the help of price manipulation overestimated the price of it, which allowed the attacker to borrow 1588 ETH, 94 WBTC, 3999669 DOLA and 39 YFI, which significantly exceeded their initial INV investment.Attack step by step:1) Attacker deployed malicious smart-contract at this address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xea0c959bbb7476ddd6cd4204bdee82b790aa1562, and swapped INV/XINV using SushiSswap and Curve.fi to manipulate price: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x20a6dcff06a791a7f8be9f423053ce8caee3f9eecc31df32445fc98d4ccd83652) Due to the small liquidity of SushiSwap on the INV/ETH pair, the exchange for 300 ETH was enough to change the price of the INV token.3) Then the attacker deposits the funds in INV received at the preparation stage and mints 1746 XINV tokens. The XINV price is calculated of INV from SushiSwap INV/ETH pair.4) With the rise in the price of XINV, the attacker was able to borrow assets using minted XINV tokens.Exploiter addresses: 1) https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b4c1083cd6aef062298e1fa900df9832c8351b32) https://etherscan.io/address/0x117c0391b3483e32aa665b5ecb2cc539669ea7e9Exploiter contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0xea0c959bbb7476ddd6cd4204bdee82b790aa1562",Borrowing and Lending,INV,0x41D5D79431A913C4aE7d69a668ecdfE5fF9DFB68,[],2022-04-02,https://twitter.com/InverseFinance/status/1510228038352457733,,14500000.0,0.0,1,1.0,0.0,"{'id': 17, 'type': 'Oracle Issue'}",{},['Ethereum'],[],4.0,5.0,92.0

Pirate claimed to have been selling bitcoins to some local tight-lipped buyers, and that he started BST to provide more volume to these buyers. By selling invested bitcoins at a high rate and rebuying them at the market price, Pirate was supposedly able to offer a very high-yield interest rate of 7% per week. This rate attracted many investors, and Pirate claimed that over 500,000 bitcoins had been deposited.After accumulating an ever-larger amount of bitcoin, transactions were becoming difficult and expensive. Pirate attempted to reduce the strain by lowering the interest rate, but this sparked unrest and mass withdrawals. After a discussion with his clients, Pirate decided to close BST and announced his intentions to return all owned bitcoins. After repaying at least 11 small beneficiaries, BST suddenly announced a default on August 28, 2012.

176,DODO,"The exploits targeted several DODO V2 Crowdpools, namely the WSZO, WCRES, ETHA, and FUSI pool.The DODO V2 Crowdpooling smart contract has a bug that allows the init() function to be called multiple times. This means that an exploiter can perform an attack with the following steps:1. Exploiter creates a counterfeit token and initializes the smart contract with it by calling the init() function.2. Exploiter calls the sync() function and sets the “reserve” variable, which represents the token balance, to 0.3. Exploiter calls init() again to re-initialize - this time with a “real” token (i.e. tokens in DODO’s pools)Exploiter uses a flash loan to transfer all real tokens from the pools and bypass the flash loan check.The exploiter 1:- interacted with a centralized exchange- withdrew 0.46597 ETH from Binance: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x970b32a8c81dd3fc47fa118621726fc418ec3526c4379470a4000ed7b448360f- executed, in quick succession, 7 BUSD withdrawal transactions (see the link for one example), possibly involving the Binance Bridge: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x300de107cbca466abe121112848daaf7f5f0d15625d54773dd0bbbff4e276e93- transferred 67,416 BUSD to 0xa305fab8bda7e1638235b054889b3217441dd645 twice: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x306d08f3d8af85dfdea7a6edb336d7504e8ecc7c609e4b940d188ba68e11cab5 https://etherscan.io/tx/0x56dbf6421c6e6bd779ab0c12fd49e1f7714dd85023aa74abae1940f8d88669cf- transferred 59,245.324743 USDT to 0xa305fab8bda7e1638235b054889b3217441dd645 twice: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbee2f507b2f4b4321927a9762dac757df12fe1ba2d6f85314273b9ea542a5c13 https://cn.etherscan.com/tx/0xaf80cf58c88f0e0f2f44e3902e4c7cd2c17122511fbc6c2d9b2cd43fbc4199b9- executed two exploits against DODO smart contracts.

This allowed the exploit contract to use those LP tokens as collateral for borrowing crypto assets from Cheese Bank- raised the CHEESE price at UniswapV2 by swapping 20k ETH to 288k CHEESE, making the UNI_V2 LP tokens more valuable as collaterals Cheese Bank. This is the crucial step in this incident since the Cheese Bank uses the amount of WETH in a liquidity pool to estimate the price of the corresponding LP token. The manipulated UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH pool (with 20k+ WETH) allowed the attacker to drain all the USDC, USDT, and DAI withheld by Cheese Bank by legit borrow() calls- refreshed the price feeds of Cheese Bank. The attacker intentionally invoked the CheesePriceOracle::refresh() function to refresh the price of the UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH LP token which is derived from the amount of WETH in the liquidity pool and the ETH price derived from the UNI_V2-USDT-ETH pool. Specifically, the CheesePriceOracle::fetchLPAnhorPrice() function gets the wEthBalance of UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH contract. With the passed in ethPrice, the totalValue is derived by wEthBalance x 2 x ethPrice. Therefore, the unit price of the UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH LP token is computed by totalValue / totalSupply of LP tokens. It means if the attacker could somehow increase the amount of WETH in a pool (e.g., addLiquidity() with flash loan ether), the price of the LP token would be increased- drained the USDC, USDT, DAI withheld by Cheese Bank by borrow() calls. Besides the 2M USDC, 1.23M USDT and 87k DAI are borrowed from Cheese Bank. The exact balance of USDC/USDT/DAI is borrowed by the exploit contract- swapped 288k CHEESE back to 19.98k ETH at UniswapV2- swapped 58k USDC to 132 ETH at UniswapV2- collected assets into https://etherscan.io/address/02b7165d0916e373f0235056a7e6fccdb82d2255- repaid 21k ETH flashloan to dYdX.",Borrowing and Lending,CHEESE,0xA04bDB1f11413a84D1F6C1d4d4FeD0208F2e68bF,[],2020-11-06,"https://cheesebank2020.medium.com/cheese-bank-detailed-statement-a765372dd84f, https://peckshield.medium.com/cheese-bank-incident-root-cause-analysis-d076bf87a1e7",https://web.archive.org/web/20201015130236/https://cheesebank.io/,3300000.0,0.0,1,0.0,0.0,"{'id': 15, 'type': 'Flash Loan Attack'}",{},['Ethereum'],[],11.0,4.0,311.0

David Bailey claimed to be from yBitcoin, a digital currency newspaper and asked for Mr. Krohn's opinion on a bitcoin industry whitepaper.David Bailey's computer had apparently been hijacked as well, and the email forwarded to Mr. Krohn pointed him to a hacker-controlled website. Mr. Krohn was requested to give his login credentials for his workplace email account on the hacker's website. The hacker was subsequently able to transfer unlawful transactions using Mr. Krohn's work email account utilizing those credentials. This occurred on December 11th and 12th, 2014.The hacker initially investigated how BitPay conducted business. He then used Mr. Krohn's email account to send emails to BitPay CEO Stephen Pair. Mr. Pair was instructed in the emails to send 1,000 bitcoins to a customer's wallet, which he did. Mr. Pair then received a second email requesting that he give another 1,000 bitcoins to the same buyer, which he did.The hacker became more daring the next day. In his email, he requested that the BitPay CEO give an additional 3,000 bitcoins. Mr. Pair wrote an email to Mr. Krohn asking for confirmation this time, not realizing that Mr. Krohn's email had been hijacked. It was found because Mr. Pair duplicated the customer on the 3,000 bitcoin transfer.

225,Mirror Protocol (2),"Terra's Mirror Protocol was exploited for ~$2 million. This exploit was made possible through validators' usage of outdated oracle software.Details of the ExploitThe Mirror Protocol was a synthetic assets protocol that allowed users to deposit $USTC or $LUNAC with a lockup period in order to mint synthetic stocks and commodities. It is noteworthy that the new Terra Network was launched within days after the collapse of the Terra Classic Network. The protocol suffered an exploit in the amount of $2 million caused by outdated oracle price feeds. The price feeds used the price of the new Luna Coin instead of the LunaC. While the new Luna coin was trading at a price around 5$ at the time, the $LUNAC coin was practically worthless at a price point of fractions of a cent. This meant that for $1k in $LUNC an attacker could deposit $1,3 million in deposit and borrow against it. Due to this mechanism, attackers drained several pools on the platform.Block Data ReferenceExample Transaction: https://finder.terra.money/classic/tx/F830681D8FEACC4DA67E84D40C49F0FF805609F2BB5CCC39A0EFE66257F2D791","Borrowing and Lending,Other",MIR,"https://etherscan.io/address/0x09a3EcAFa817268f77BE1283176B946C4ff2E608, https://bscscan.com/address/0x5B6DcF557E2aBE2323c48445E8CC948910d8c2c9, https://finder.terra.money/classic/address/terra15gwkyepfc6xgca5t5zefzwy42uts8l2m4g40k6",[],2022-05-31,https://www.theblock.co/post/149361/mirror-protocol-suffers-new-exploit-and-could-be-drained-in-hours,,2000000.0,0.0,1,0.0,1.0,"{'id': 17, 'type': 'Oracle Issue'}",{},['Terra Classic'],[],5.0,1.0,151.0

Only days before the migration a developer on the team hardcoded the maximum fees on the crv and mim pool contracts to 17%.

Subsequently, the developer launched a new smart contract in order to cover his tracks. Through these mechanisms the dishonest deployer was pledged rewards in the billions by the smart contracts. All of the above mentioned proxy updates completely changed the functionality of the smart contracts and would not have been possible a couple of days later after the multisig migration would have concluded.

This platform allows users to stake NFT tokens to receive fungible tokens e.g. $ETH. The attacker deposited NFTs from the collection Doodles that were used as a collateral to borrow $WETH. Then the attacker exploited a vulnerability in order to execute a reentrancy attack by withdrawing all NFTs deposited as collateral by the attacker except for one NFT. This action triggered a malicious callback function that allowed the attacker to buy more Doodles before  liquidating the loan position: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x05d65e0adddc5d9ccfe6cd65be4a7899ebcb6e5ec7a39787971bcc3d6ba73996When the position is liquidated, the remaining Doodle NFT from the collateral were returned to the attacker.

290,OpenSea,"A bug has been exploited to purchase NFTs from users of OpenSea, at well below market value.Was identified at least five attackers who have exploited this loophole to purchase at least twelve NFTs for much less than their market value. These include Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Cool Cats, and Cyberkongz NFTs.The exploit:- when you list an item for sale (or bid) you are signing data that validate that you are willing to sell your NFT at this price- the signature is saved in OpenSea's DB off-chain and when someone wants to buy your NFT, they will send to their smart contract your previously signed data where the signature and sale information (such as expiration & price) are validated on-chain before making the transfer- when you cancel a listing, you are required to perform a transaction. The reason is that someone might save your signed listing (which are public - i.e https://orders.rarible.com or even their API) and use it later, even if the listing got removed from the UI- the transaction on-chain will save the fact that you canceled this sale on their smart contract and even if someone will try to use your signed data from before, the on-chain validation will reject the sale- the bug stems from the fact that previously you could re-list an NFT without canceling it and all the previous listings are not canceled on-chain, this is why re-listing will not workFor example, at around 7 am on January 24, a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT #9991 was purchased for 0.77 ETH ($1,800).

It is not clear why the site didn’t secure its funds at that time.The addresses Kipcoin claimed belong to the hacker:1Chg6NxMeTcZ3DQvYA9gocjU4RQwH1LtKD18zf9CWe4uBy8BesHU3BWqjpibDRRBoPLD1MYkHXvnWuZ5FaMJkNv4uCLoVC2Ztp2DXK152BSsbpcGMdj9WBGHq3wXHgJVuqQCs4aJ16j131w3cvkdAc13sg5nREMiiJj3zoRw5n16qHXy4RDeek56mNDN84d2F6niE96taQso175L5Sx81dZZBureP8RtLUyUXoruVdAj1E17ZJ1sqDRxq7oRVrnNLxoyrvHrtrjtPRfp17amdMD8JJPcipWqUEwzEtsAuYu1FzkVtg181qVdiaCcJmzGJV9PEobeYYnkC25PyJdT18ncsALSWGWRG3JK6yio4PXoiWBbvxAxng1XgAzaQEe9iDEohWCmdNXSH8XZ74uLBnd",CeFi,,,[],2015-02-18,https://coinjournal.net/news/chinese-exchange-kipcoin-hacked/,https://web.archive.org/web/20140414030418/https://kipcoin.com/,721000.0,0.0,1,0.0,0.0,"{'id': 9, 'type': 'Access control'}",{},['CEX'],[],2.0,2.0,49.0

The first batch was sold for 540 ETH in KyberSwap that, after internal consulting of reserves, was routed the swap order to the KyberUniswap reserve (0x31e085afd48a1d6e51cc193153d625e8f0514c7f) and got 92,419 sUSD in return. The second batch was sold 18 times for 20 ETH each, also in Kyber that, after internal consulting of reserves, routed the swap orders to the Kyber-sUSD reserve (0x4cb01bd05e4652cbb9f312ae604f4549d2bf2c99) and got 63,584 sUSD in return. The sell-off of these two batches effectively drove the price of sUSD up to 0.00899 ETH (or 1ETH=111 sUSD). The manipulated price is around 2.5x higher when compared to the average ETH/sUSD market price. After the swap, the attacker acquired 92,419+63,584=156,003 sUSD tokens at his disposal- turned to Synthetic Depot contract to acquire substantially more sUSD at market price. Note Synthetic Depot contract allows for depositing Ether for sUSD at a fair rate. The attacker sent 6,000 ETH and bought 943,837 sUSD back (with 2,482 ETH refunded back as there’s no enough sUSD to buy). Note this step is typically launched before the previous step. For whatever reason, this is not the case in this particular hack (and the ordering does not affect the final result as the pricing in Synthetic Depot is not affected by KyberSwap)- the sUSD/ETH price was driven up and the attacker has >1M sUSD at his disposal. Note that the attacker takes the approach by capitalizing on the spiked price in a profitable Compound position in the first hack. Considering the possibly low liquidity of sUSD, the attacker this time takes the approach of first collateralizing the collected >1M sUSD back into bZx and then borrowing from it 6,796 ETH.

The result of performing the above swaps is to intentionally left 1e-18 in the Balancer pool- by sending in 1e-18 STA into BPool via swapExactAmountIn(), the attacker swapped out 30,347 WETH in the first run. In internal records for book-keeping, _records[STA] is increased by tokenAmountIn (i.e., 1) before the BPool contract actually collects the corresponding STA tokens from the msg.sender- the _pullUnderlying() function collected the STA tokens. Note: STA is a deflationary token that charges shown 1% on every token transfer. Because of the transfer fee cut, the Balancer pool actually got zero STA tokens. Therefore, there’s a mismatch between the actual STA balance of BPool and its internal records (i.e., _records[STA])- The gulp() is exploited to reset the _records[STA], which helps the attacker to maintain the state that BPool has only 1e-18 STA- repaid the flash loan back to dYdX.",Exchange (DEX),BAL,0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d,[],2020-06-28,"https://peckshield.medium.com/balancer-hacks-root-cause-and-loss-analysis-4916f7f0fff5, https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/69785/balancer-pools-drained-of-more-than-450000-due-to-an-exploit-connected-to-deflationary-tokens, https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-protocol-balancer-hacked-through-exploit-it-seemingly-knew-about",,523613.0,0.0,1,0.0,0.0,"{'id': 15, 'type': 'Flash Loan Attack'}",{},['Ethereum'],"[{'audit_link': 'safe/files/audit/pdf/Balancer_Finance_ConsenSys_Diligence1.pdf', 'date': '2020-05-15T00:00:00.000Z', 'partner': {'id': 14, 'name': 'ConsenSys Diligence', 'logo_link': 'safe/files/partner/logo/609524af19cf1.jpeg'}}, {'audit_link': 'safe/files/audit/pdf/BalancerCore.pdf', 'date': '2020-03-05T00:00:00.000Z', 'partner': {'id': 18, 'name': 'Trail of Bits', 'logo_link': 'safe/files/partner/logo/60a7a1cccf039.jpeg'}}, {'audit_link': 'safe/files/audit/pdf/Balancer_Contracts_Audit_OpenZeppelin_blog.pdf', 'date': '2020-08-09T00:00:00.000Z', 'partner': {'id': 20, 'name': 'OpenZeppelin', 'logo_link': 'safe/files/partner/logo/60adfe82d2af6.jpeg'}}, {'audit_link': 'safe/files/audit/pdf/Balancer_Finance_Process_Quality_Review_PQ_Reviews.pdf', 'date': '2020-07-31T00:00:00.000Z', 'partner': {'id': 23, 'name': 'DeFi Safety', 'logo_link': 'safe/files/partner/logo/6154df0c5cbef.png'}}]",6.0,6.0,180.0

384,Cauldron,"The biggest flash loan attack on Avalanche in 2022 was detected. The attacker took 370,000 $USD after interacting with several assets.Details of the ExploitThe attacker interacted with Cauldron, Aave, JoeSwap, and Curve for various purposes. The attacker used a malicious smart contract with an unverified source code to withdraw 998,000 $nxUSD using LP tokens worth 500,000 $USDC. The full attack flow of the exploit transaction succeeded as follows:   1. The attackers malicious contract flashloaned 51,000,000 $USDC from Aave   2. 280,000 $USDC were swapped to $WAVAX with JoeSwap   3. liquidity was added using claimed $WAVAX and 260,000 $USDC so 0.0045 JoeLPToken was received   4. The remaining 50,460,000 $USDC were swapped for $WAVAX on JoeSwap and it changed the reserve of the pool   5. The attackers contract called the updateExchangeRate function on the CauldronV2 smart contract, which changed the ExchangeRate variable according to the previous JoeSwap pool's reserve amount   6. The attackers contract deposited 0.0045 JoeLPToken to the CauldronV2 and 998,000 $nxUSD were withdrawn from DegenBox. Because of the manipulated ExchangeRate variable, the attacker was able to take that amount for 500,000 $USD worth JoeLPTokens   7. The remaining $WAVAX were swapped back for 50,426,896 $USDC on the previous JoeSwap pool   8. Consequently, Curve.fi and other pools were used to swap 998,000 $nxUSD for 970,010 $USDC   9. The 51,025,500 $USDC for the flash loan were paid back to Aave   10.

The hack proceeds in two parts.In the first part, the hacker used a scanner to track new token pairs, and stole $WBNB on PancakePair contract. In the second part, another attacker used the burn function, which mistakenly allows any user to burn $SDF tokens from any address. The attacker burns almost all $SDF tokens on the liquidity pool, so the token price was unfairly high. He deployed an exploit smart contract to use the situation to swap 9 $SDF tokens for 1078 $WBNB and made a profit of 302,817 $USD.

Looking at the transaction details, the slippage control values correctly reflected the 1% tolerance, but the LP value still did not conform.The problem: a Miner Extractable Value (MEV) bot inspected the transaction, bundled the transactions such that the bot could make financial profits, and sent these transactions privately to a particular group of miners who then mined these transactions.The Uniswap V2 Router contract has implicit assumptions that are not clearly stated on the contract level. Hence, without stating these assumptions, slippage control for some trades on Uniswap V2 may not be checked and may not be taken into account at all in certain scenarios.These implicit assumptions on Uniswap V2 resulted in 20 addresses on Alpha Homora V2 being impacted and lost a total of 40.93 ETH to miners who extracted this value.The list of affected addresses: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 affected addresses were compensated.",,ALPHA,0xa1faa113cbe53436df28ff0aee54275c13b40975,[],2021-10-23,https://blog.alphafinance.io/mev-bots-uniswap-implicit-assumptions/,,170704.0,170704.0,1,0.0,0.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",{},['Ethereum'],[],10.0,5.0,296.0

This leads to a typical pattern of token attacks: if the balance of a Uniswap pair can be reduced without any swap (i.e. the difference between the recorded reserves and the actual token balances), there is a possibility of price manipulation.3) The attack is carried out by switching from a pair of WBNB-Hackerdao to a pair of BSCUSD-Hackerdao, which leads to an unbalanced price.",,Hackerdao,0x94e06c77b02Ade8341489Ab9A23451F68c13eC1C,[],2022-05-24,,https://twitter.com/BlockSecTeam/status/1529084919976034304,65155.0,0.0,1,1.0,0.0,"{'id': 15, 'type': 'Flash Loan Attack'}",{},['Binance'],[],5.0,1.0,144.0

One of these was Alberto Armandi, who was related to Bitscalper, a scam earlier that year. Alberto Armandi reportedly hacked into the website he himself helped code. The vulnerability was in the withdrawal script that Alberto coded, reportedly intentionally as a backdoor. Although incredible, Armandi has also released a story denying he hacked the website.

As said on the official project's Twitter, the private key of the token deployer was leaked, so the hacker was able to transfer ownership to himself, and mint unlimited $GERA tokens. Consequently, the hacker minted 2,179,340,915 ERC20 GERA tokens on the Ethereum network and 275,900,000 GERA BEP20 tokens on the Binance network.

850,Iron Finance (2),"On the 16th of April, TITAN reached an all-time high of $64 and some investors cashed out. As a result, the price dropped to $60, where it remained for a time.However, when TITAN fell below $60, it prompted a fresh wave of selling by big investors, commonly known as whales, driving the price down below $30. Because of the decline in the TITAN price, the IRON stablecoin lost its peg and fell to $0.90. This is where the real issues started.The price oracle, which is a smart contract that generates token prices from liquidity pools, could not keep up with the volatility since it utilizes a 10 minute Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) to determine the CR. Users could purchase IRON tokens for $0.90 and instantly redeem them for $0.75 USDC and $0.25 TITAN, which they could then sell for a risk-free profit.Investors were ready to purchase dips in IRON and TITAN, helping IRON to briefly reclaim its peg and driving the TITAN price back up to $50.This triggered another wave of selling as additional major traders began to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity, flooding the market with newly minted TITAN and finally dumping it as the price approached zero. As a result, IRON fell further, reaching a low of $0.58 before rebounding to $0.74 at the time of writing.The TITAN supply that was supposed to be capped at 1 billion tokens expanded without limit.",,TITAN,0xaaa5b9e6c589642f98a1cda99b9d024b8407285a,[],2021-06-16,"https://ironfinance.medium.com/iron-finance-post-mortem-17-june-2021-6a4e9ccf23f5, https://cointelegraph.com/news/mark-cuban-calls-for-stablecoin-regulation-in-wake-of-iron-finance-bank-run, https://thedefiant.io/iron-finance-implodes-after-bank-run/",,0.0,0.0,1,0.0,0.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",{},['Polygon'],[],6.0,2.0,167.0

2055,Test,"A complex mixture of events and market dynamics cost the implosion of the $40b Terra (Classic) Network. Details of the ExploitThe Terra Luna Network was focused on its two native coins $LUNC and $USTC. $USTC was the algorithmic Stablecoin that was supposed to hold the peg to 1$ and $LUNC functioned as the satellite asset that absorbed $USTC’s volatility. This was achieved through a mint and burn functionality as well as by arbitrage which the former function inherently enabled.$USTC rose to prominence in rapid fashion even surpassing $DAI in market cap. The Luna Foundation Group decided to start a new Curve4pool with $FRAX, $USTC, $USDC and $USDT as assets, excluding $DAI in an attempt to starve the most used StableCoin pool used by institutions the Curve3pool on the Ethereum network.The migration of $USTC from the Curve3pool is the event that started the bankrun. In early May, the Luna Foundation Guard withdrew 250 million $USTC from the Curve3pool in preparation for the Curve4pool. Simultaneously, a handful of whales withdrew sizeable amounts from the anchor protocol, a crypto savings bank. The biggest wallet withdrew 347 million $USTC in total and bridged funds to the Curve3pool in order to swap for other assets. This movement of funds created an imbalance between $USTC and other Stablecoins in the pool, resulting in devaluation of $USTC on exchanges. As a result of the tokenomics of $USTC and $LUNC the firesale of $USTC resulted in uncontrollable minting of the $LUNC token and a rapid fall in valuation. Additionally, the Terra network went down due to overload in transaction as market participants were panicking and trying to answer margin calls within the Anchor protocol. Eventually massive liquidations of collateral in the Anchor protocol would be incurred by investors.Blockdata Reference Whale Addresses:https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d47f08ebc5554504742f547eb721a43d4947d0ahttps://etherscan.io/address/0x4b5e60cb1cd6c5e67af5e6cf63229d1614bb781chttps://etherscan.io/address/0x1df8ea15bb725e110118f031e8e71b91abaa2a06https://etherscan.io/address/0xeb5425e650b04e49e5e8b62fbf1c3f60df01f232https://etherscan.io/address/0x41339d9825963515e5705df8d3b0ea98105ebb1chttps://etherscan.io/address/0x68963dc7c28a36fcacb0b39ac2d807b0329b9c69https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f705ff1da72ed334f0e80f90aae5644f5cd7784",CeFi,Test,0xf30e4da2af4ebc4172e412ecd1e7a5d8fb600e30,[],2021-10-24,"https://twitter.com/Token_Sniffer/status/1381346761566916614, 	https://cryptot3ddybear.gitlab.io/blog/posts/scam-explained-bsc-stealthy-lp-block/",,0.0,0.0,1,0.0,0.0,"{'id': 7, 'type': 'Honeypot'}",{},['CEX'],[],10.0,6.0,297.0
